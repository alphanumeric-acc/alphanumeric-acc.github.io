##### üõ§Ô∏è The Path to Effective Documentation
When you introduce a new version of your API, it is important to provide documentation for each version so that clients can understand how to use both versions effectively.

##### üîç Use PathSelectors to filter endpoints to create version-specific documentation
Enter Springfox, a beacon of light in the API development landscape. Nestled within the Docket object, PathSelectors emerge as your allies. These nifty tools empower you to filter endpoints based on ant pattern matching, rendering your documentation generation efforts laser-focused.

##### üìë The Blueprint of Success
Picture this: each API version basks in its own dedicated documentation oasis. Thanks to PathSelectors, you can tailor your documentation to include only the endpoints pertinent to each version. The result? Swagger UI for each distinct version, making navigation a breeze.

##### üìù The Code Unveiled
For those who crave code snippets, the solution lies in the comments section. Dive in and unearth the magic of incorporating PathSelectors to sculpt version-specific documentation.

#### Conclusion
With this pro tip in head, the journey of API versioning becomes not only smoother but also well-documented. Empower your clients with the resources they need to traverse multiple API iterations, unlocking the true potential of your APIs. As you embark on this documentation practice, remember that a well-organized API is a gift that keeps on giving.<br/> Share this wisdom with your fellow developers, shaping a future where versioned APIs seamlessly coexist with comprehensive documentation. üöÄ
