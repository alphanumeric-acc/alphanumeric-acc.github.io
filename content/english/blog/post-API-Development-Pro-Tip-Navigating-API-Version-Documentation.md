#### Introduction

Welcome to simple tips for making API development easier. Today, we're going to talk about how to document different versions of APIs. As we make new versions of APIs, it's important to explain how they work. In this article, I'll show you how to use tools like Springfox to make guides for each version of your API. This will help your clients use different versions of your API easily.

##### Making a Good Guide
Each new version of an API introduces new features and changes. It's our job to help users understand these changes. Good documentation for each version is key. It helps clients know how to use both old and new versions of your API. It also makes using your API a better experience.

##### Using PathSelectors to Make Version-Specific Guides
In API development, Springfox is a great tool. It has many powerful features, including PathSelectors. PathSelectors are part of the Docket object. They help you make version-specific guides. With PathSelectors, you can select endpoints based on patterns. This makes your guide precise and efficient. It's like having a compass to help you navigate your API structure.

##### Building a Successful Guide
Imagine a world where each API version has its own section in your guide. This section only has information about that version. With PathSelectors, you can make this happen. You can select only the endpoints that are related to each version. This results in a clear Swagger UI for each version. It's easy for your clients to understand and use.

##### Practical Examples
For those who learn best by doing, check out the comments section. You'll find code snippets and examples of how to use the ideas in this article. See how PathSelectors work in real life, and learn how to make version-specific guides.

#### Conclusion
With these tips, you can make API versioning easier and more user-friendly. By giving your clients the resources they need, you make your APIs more useful. Remember that a well-organized API is a gift that keeps on giving. So, share this knowledge with your fellow developers. Let's work together to make API development and documentation better for everyone. Here's to a brighter future in API development! ðŸš€
